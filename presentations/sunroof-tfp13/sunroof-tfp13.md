# What is Sunroof?

 * Foreign Function Interface
 * Platform for hybrid Haskell/JavaScript applications


## Features

 * Types
 * Haskell-style (cooperative) concurrency
 * Simple, ready to use server


## Example

Example, show types

```haskell
jsCode :: JS t ()
jsCode = do
    name <- prompt "Your name?"
    alert ("Your name: " <> name)
```
